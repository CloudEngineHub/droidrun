title: Overview
---

Welcome to the DroidRun v4 Guides! Here you'll find comprehensive step-by-step instructions and best practices for using DroidRun's powerful features. Each guide is designed to help you master specific aspects of the framework, from basic setup to advanced automation patterns.

---

## Getting Started

### [Device Setup & Communication](./device-setup)
Learn how to set up Android and iOS devices, install the Portal app, and establish reliable communication. This guide covers:
- Installing and configuring the DroidRun Portal app
- Enabling accessibility services and permissions
- TCP vs Content Provider communication modes
- Wireless debugging setup (WiFi/network connections)
- Multi-device management and troubleshooting
- iOS device setup and limitations

---

### [Configuration System](./configuration)
Master DroidRun's powerful YAML-based configuration system that controls every aspect of agent behavior. This guide covers:
- Config file structure and path resolution
- LLM profiles for different agent types (Manager, Executor, CodeAct, Scripter)
- Mixing LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, DeepSeek)
- Agent modes (reasoning vs direct execution)
- Safe execution restrictions for code generation
- CLI overrides and configuration best practices
- Prompt customization with Jinja2 templates

---

## Core Features

### [Event Streaming](../concepts/event-streaming)
Understand DroidRun's real-time event system for monitoring agent execution and building custom integrations. This guide covers:
- Two-tier event architecture (coordination vs internal events)
- Manager, Executor, and CodeAct event types
- Building custom event handlers with Rich UI
- Event streaming for WebSocket/FastAPI integrations
- Real-time monitoring and debugging patterns
- Event aggregation and replay for analysis

---

### [Multi-Agent Architecture](../concepts/workflow-architecture)
Explore DroidRun's hierarchical agent system with Manager-Executor workflows. This guide covers:
- Reasoning mode (Manager â†’ Executor) vs Direct mode (CodeAct)
- DroidAgent as the main orchestrator
- ManagerAgent for high-level planning and task decomposition
- ExecutorAgent for atomic action selection
- CodeActAgent for immediate code generation
- ScripterAgent for off-device Python execution
- Shared state and coordination patterns

---

### [Structured Output](./structured-output)
Extract structured, type-safe data from device interactions using Pydantic models. This guide covers:
- Defining Pydantic output models with Field descriptions
- Post-completion extraction workflow
- Nested models, lists, and optional fields
- Real-world examples (contacts, invoices, settings, reviews)
- Validation, error handling, and troubleshooting
- Combining structured output with custom variables

---

## Advanced Features

### [Custom Tools & Credentials](./custom-tools-credentials)
Extend agent capabilities with custom functions and secure credential storage. This guide covers:
- Creating custom tool functions with proper signatures
- Async tool support and error handling
- Credential manager setup and configuration
- Encrypted credential storage (passwords, API keys)
- Using `type_secret` for secure input
- Combining custom tools with credentials
- Best practices for tool descriptions and validation

---

### [Custom Variables](./custom-variables)
Pass dynamic data and configuration to agents for parameterized workflows. This guide covers:
- Variable injection into agent prompts
- Passing variables to Manager, Executor, and CodeAct agents
- Accessing variables in custom tools
- Use cases: parameterized emails, API endpoints, user preferences
- Multi-step workflows with shared context
- Variable validation with Pydantic
- Security considerations for variables vs credentials

---

### [App Cards](./app-cards)
Enhance agent performance with app-specific instruction cards for better UI understanding. This guide covers:
- How app cards work (package detection and prompt injection)
- Built-in app cards (Gmail, Chrome, etc.)
- Creating custom app cards with markdown
- App card format and best practices
- Card providers: Local, Server, and Composite modes
- Dynamic card loading and caching
- Testing and maintaining app cards

---

## Operations

### [Telemetry & Tracing](../guides/telemetry-tracing)
Monitor and analyze agent execution with Arize Phoenix tracing and trajectory recording. This guide covers:
- Arize Phoenix integration for real-time execution monitoring
- LLM call inspection and performance analysis
- Trajectory recording at "none", "step", or "action" level
- Step-by-step debugging with screenshots and UI state
- Token usage monitoring and optimization
- Anonymous framework usage analytics (PostHog)
