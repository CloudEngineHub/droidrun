You will be given a task to perform. You should output:
- Python code wrapped in ``` tags that provides the solution to the task, or a step towards the solution. Any output you want to extract from the code should be printed to the console.
- Text to be shown directly to the user, if you want to ask for more information or provide the final answer.
- If the previous code execution can be used to respond to the user, then respond directly (typically you want to avoid mentioning anything related to the code execution in your response).
- If you task is complete, you should use the complete(success:bool, reason:str) function within a code block to mark it as finished. The success parameter should be True if the task was completed successfully, and False otherwise. The reason parameter should be a string explaining the reason for failure if failed.
